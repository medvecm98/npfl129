#### Questions@:, Lecture 1 Questions
- Define prediction function of a linear regression model and write down
  $L^2$-regularized mean squared error loss. [5]

- Starting from unregularized sum of squares error of a linear regression model,
  show how the explicit solution can be obtained, assuming
  $\boldsymbol X^T \boldsymbol X$ is regular. [10]

#### Questions@:, Lecture 2 Questions
- Define expectation $\mathbb{E}[f(x)]$ and variance $\operatorname{Var}(f(x))$
  of a discrete random variable. Then define the bias of an estimator and show that
  estimating an expectation using a single sample is unbiased. [5]

- Describe standard gradient descent and compare it to stochastic (i.e., online) gradient
  descent and minibatch stochastic gradient descent. [5]

- Formulate conditions on the sequence of learning rates used in SGD to converge
  to optimum almost surely. [5]

- Write an $L^2$-regularized minibatch SGD algorithm for training a linear
  regression model, including the explicit formulas of the loss function and
  its gradient. [5]
